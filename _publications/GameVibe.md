As online video and streaming platforms continue to grow, affective computing research has undergone a shift towards more complex studies involving multiple modalities. However, there is still a lack of readily available datasets with high-quality audiovisual stimuli. In this paper, we present GameVibe, a novel affect corpus which consists of multimodal audiovisual stimuli, including in-game behavioural observations and third-person affect labels for viewer engagement. The corpus consists of videos from a diverse set of publicly available gameplay sessions across 30 games, with particular attention to ensure high-quality stimuli with good audiovisual and gameplay diversity. Furthermore, we present an analysis on the reliability of the annotators in terms of inter-annotator agreement.
