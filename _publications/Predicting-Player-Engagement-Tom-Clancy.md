This paper introduces a large scale multimodal corpus collected for the purpose of analysing and predicting player engagement in commercial-standard games. The corpus is solicited from 25 players of the action role-playing game Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, who annotated their level of engagement using a time-continuous annotation tool. The cleaned and processed corpus presented in this paper consists of nearly 20 hours of annotated gameplay videos accompanied by logged gamepad actions. We report preliminary results on predicting long-term player engagement based on in-game footage and game controller actions using Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Results obtained suggest we can predict the player engagement with up to accuracy on average ( at best) when we fuse information from the game footage and the player’s controller input. Our findings validate the hypothesis that long-term (i.e. 1 hour of play) engagement can be predicted efficiently solely from pixels and gamepad actions.
