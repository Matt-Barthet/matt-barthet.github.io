In 2021-2023 I was responsible for running a tutorial on using MCEdit, a program for running python scripts in Minecraft worlds. This was part of teaching the students how to run PCG algorithms in Minecraft, where I showed how to run a cellular automata landscape generator, as well as other tools such as heightmap and edgemap scripts.
