In 2024 I was responsible for running a PCG methods tutorial, where I helped students implement basic constructive PCG methods such as cellular automata, binary space partitioning, and wave function collapse. I was also responsible for running a tutorial on using physiological and webcam sensors to gather data from human participants, and helped students implement scripts for processing and visualizing said data.
