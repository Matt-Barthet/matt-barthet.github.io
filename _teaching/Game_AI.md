In 2023-2024 I acted as course coordinate for the Game AI study unit. I was responsible for planning the course schedule with my co-lecturers, uploading content to the course website, giving lecture,s and supervise students final projects. Finally, I oversaw grading for the final project, and the oral exam and presentation at the end of the semester. In 2025 I acted as teaching assistant, taking care of the schedule and material on the course website, and helped Prof. Georgios Yannakakis with supervising and grading students.
